<h1>Myrrix Upgrade Notes</h1>

<h2>Version 1.0</h2>

<h3>Serving Layer</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The behavior of <code>IDRescorer</code> has slightly changed for <code>recommendToMany</code>. The function
  is applied once per item, not for every user and for every item. That is, it is applied after the average over
  user scores has been taken, not before.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.10</h2>

<h3>All</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>model.iterations</code> parameter no longer has effect; iteration count is no longer explicitly
    specified, but instead determined dynamically by a convergence criterion: the average absolute difference
    in estimates for user-item pairs between iterations. The <code>model.als.iterations.convergenceThreshold</code>
    parameter, which defaults to 0.001, will generally cause significantly more iterations to be run. Increase
    (to 0.01 for example) for fewer iterations. The number of iterations can be capped by setting 
    <code>model.iterations.max</code> to the (positive) max number of iterations to run.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Computation Layer</h3>

<ul>
  <li>An issue has been resolved that could cause two Computation Layer computations sharing the same bucket 
    to interfere. As part of this, support files that were previously bucket-specific, and were previously 
    placed in <code>sys/</code> under a bucket, like <code>keystore.ks</code>, <code>clientthread.jar</code> 
    and <code>rescorer.jar</code>, are now instance-specific. They should now be placed in 
    <em>instance</em><code>/sys/</code>. Stop the Computation Layer instance(s), and for each bucket, copy its
    <code>sys/</code> directory into each <em>instance/</em> subdirectory. Restart the Comptutation Layer(s).
    Note that the file <code>sys/myrrix.jar</code>, will be regenerated. No migration is needed if none
    of the files listed above are used.</li>
</ul>
