<h1>Myrrix Upgrade Notes</h1>

<h2>Version 1.0</h2>

<h3>Serving Layer</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The endpoint for <code>setItemTag</code> was declared incorrectly. Requests should access
  <code>/tag/item/<strong>[itemID]/[tag]</strong></code>, not 
  <code>/tag/item/<strong>[tag]/[itemID]</strong></code>. Callers who access the REST API directly
  will need to use the corrected path.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.11</h2>

<h3>All</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The default value of <code>model.als.alpha</code> has changed from 40 to 1. This affects results if the model
  build process (Computation Layer or stand-alone Serving Layer) does not specify a fixed value for this 
  system property. The new default should result in an improvement in quality for many data sets.</li>
  <li>Handling of user-item pairs with negative strength values has changed. This has no effect for data sets that 
  contain no negative strength values. It should have a small and generally positive effect on other data sets.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Serving Layer</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The behavior of <code>IDRescorer</code> has slightly changed for <code>recommendToMany</code>. The function
  is applied once per item, not for every user and for every item. That is, it is applied after the average over
  user scores has been taken, not before.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Computation Layer</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Computation Layer <code>model.cluster.k</code> parameter has been split into <code>model.cluster.user.k</code>
  and <code>model.cluster.item.k</code> to control k for user and item clustering, respectively. If using the
  old parameter, specify one (or both) new paramters now instead.</li>
  <li>Note that the Computation Layer will now delete old generations, keeping 10 generations by default</li>
</ul>

<h2>Version 0.10</h2>

<h3>All</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The <code>model.iterations</code> parameter no longer has effect; iteration count is no longer explicitly
    specified, but instead determined dynamically by a convergence criterion: the average absolute difference
    in estimates for user-item pairs between iterations. The <code>model.als.iterations.convergenceThreshold</code>
    parameter, which defaults to 0.001, will generally cause significantly more iterations to be run. Increase
    (to 0.01 for example) for fewer iterations. The number of iterations can be capped by setting 
    <code>model.iterations.max</code> to the (positive) max number of iterations to run.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Computation Layer</h3>

<ul>
  <li>An issue has been resolved that could cause two Computation Layer computations sharing the same bucket 
    to interfere. As part of this, support files that were previously bucket-specific, and were previously 
    placed in <code>sys/</code> under a bucket, like <code>keystore.ks</code>, <code>clientthread.jar</code> 
    and <code>rescorer.jar</code>, are now instance-specific. They should now be placed in 
    <em>instance</em><code>/sys/</code>. Stop the Computation Layer instance(s), and for each bucket, copy its
    <code>sys/</code> directory into each <em>instance/</em> subdirectory. Restart the Comptutation Layer(s).
    Note that the file <code>sys/myrrix.jar</code>, will be regenerated. No migration is needed if none
    of the files listed above are used.</li>
</ul>
